# Bug_Log

A work-in-progress application that will allow users to log and view bugs, and conduct a number of operations on previously logged bugs. Functionality for user login and bug allocation is planned for future, along with the ability to sort bugs by allocation, date, etc.

This is built purely as a tool for learning JavaScript.
